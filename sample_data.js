This will soften the leaves and make it easer to roll them and faster to cook. Remove the leaves with a slotted spoon and drain. Cut off the stems or any hard veins. If using canned leaves, put them in batches in colander and place the colander under a sink, then rinse the leaves under cold water and drain. Cut off the stems. If using medium or large leaves, cut them in half. If there are any torn or damaged leaves, do not discard - use them to patch holes in other leaves. NOTE: If canned leaves are too thick, blanch them in boiling water for about a minute, then drain and proceed as directed in the recipe.|Hold a grape leaf shiny side down on the palm of your left hand, and place 1 or 2 teaspoons of the filling at the stalk end of the leaf. With your right hand, fold top, then the sides over the filling and roll up tightly.|Arrange the stuffed grape leaves close together seam side down in a medium non-stick pan, making several layers. If using fresh grape leaves, sprinkle a little salt in between each layer.|Pour butter over the grape leaves and add water. Place a small lid or a small ovenproof plate on top to keep dolmas tight and to prevent them from opening. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium to low and simmer for 1 hour 30 minutes, or until the leaves are tender and the filling is cooked. There should be little liquid left, reduced to the oily consistency.|Serve hot with garlic-yogurt sauce scooped on top, fresh salad or pickles and bread!",
        "description": "The traditional recipe calls for minced lamb mixed with rice and flavoured with mint, fennel, and cinnamon, and wrapped in vine leaves (yarpaq dolması). There is this irresistible flavor of aromatic fresh herbs mixed with that of meat and rice. Also, it is smaller and rounder (or squarer) in shape than its foreign counterparts that usually have longer tube-like shapes. Try it with a scoop of creamy garlic-yogurt sauce on top and you will promise to yourself to make this dish again as soon as possible!",

        "steps": "Preheat a fan-assisted oven to 180°C fan / 400°F and line a large baking tray with baking paper.|Wash and dry the potatoes, then push a skewer through the middle of each potato lengthways.|Using a sharp knife, carefully carve each potato at an angle into a spiral. Cut down as far as the skewer, cutting diagonally along the potato so each spiral is roughly 0.5 cm thick. Then transfer both potatoes to the pre-lined baking tray.|Combine the olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder and cumin powder in a small bow. Then brush over the potatoes on both sides, making sure the spirals are completey coated.|Add the baking tray to the oven and bake the potatoes for 50-60 minutes, turning over half way to make sure the potatoes are crispy all over. The thicker your spirals, the longer the potato will need to cook in the oven! If the potato is slightly undercooked, leave it in the oven for another 10-15 minutes.|To serve, drizzle with yoghurt, dried onion flakes, coriander and chilli sauce. It’s up to you how many toppings you want to use!",
